To do:

- When no information is saved, delete row

- Descriptions

- Recommendations

- More user control

- re-roll ability scores, put own guidelines, etc

- make drag-and-drop not depend on UI choices




Bugs:

- Click select then an in-progress character
	When click finish, it returns to Select screen, but isn't refreshed

- Click select
	Creates empty bar at end of finished table
	When click empty bar, opens possibly first in created table

- On ability score selector
	can replace one option with another






Done:
- detail:
	shows name and ability scores for finished characters

- select:
	clicking on finished character launches detail fragment
	clicking on in-progress character launches create fragment (and edits entry instead of creating new one)

- create:
	multi page, navigate with swipes
	save into temporary database on edit (name, ability)
	save into permanent database on click create (name, ability)

- ability score selector:
	drag and drop interface for correctly generated stats to choose from
